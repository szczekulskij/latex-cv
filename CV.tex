\runsubsection{The Hut Group}
\descript{| Data Scientist Experimentation}
\location{Sept 2020 – Present | Manchester, UK}
\quad
\begin{tightemize}

% -> point 1
\item Improved \& automated A/B testing tools surrounding internal A/B testing such as duration estimation or automated analyses tool. Improved internal backend used for managing experiments.

% -> point 2
\item I led the `experimentable widgets` project, which enabled stakeholders to make changes to site widgets as A/B tests. To do this, I had to look into and make alterations to the larger internal architecture, which included 4 backends and 2 frontends

% -> point 3
\item I conducted multiple A/B/n tests, while providing deep data analysis. The experiment yielded a yearly cost savings of £1 million for the company.

% -> point 4
\item Helped develop a company-wide ML algorithm responsible for short-term demand forecasting.

% -> point 5
\item Created data pipelines from the beginning, including configuring a virtual machine, Jenkins, and scripts.

\descript{| Research Assistant}
\location{2021-present}
\begin{tightemize}

% -> point 1
\item Analyzed data on long-term treatment of PWS-type birthmarks.  Research revealed that if treatment is discontinued, the condition will worsen. Consequently, this lead to introduction of a novel sustained treatment for PWS.

% -> point 2
\item I am currently conducting research that aims to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the numerical and visual success rate of laser treatment for birthmarks, by leveraging the relationship between the position and colour of the marks and the treatment's effectiveness.

\location{June 2020 – Aug 2020 | Liverpool, UK}
\location{Aug 2022 – Present | Liverpool, UK}
\begin{tightemize}
% -> point 1
\item Research focused on maximizing the efficacy of tomography reconstruction via the employment of classification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify the best angles for 3D nanowire reconstruction. This is based on the sinograms of the 2D slices of the nanowires.

\section{Projects}
\runsubsection{Improving DDPG}
\descript{| Python, Numpy,PyTorch}
\location{2020}
\begin{tightemize}

% -> point 1
\item Implemented \& improved stability and convergence of reinforcement learning algorithm DDPG using Stochastic Weighted Average \& One-Cycle methods.

\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Monet me this}
\descript{| Python, Numpy, PyTorch}
\location{2022}
\begin{tightemize}

% -> point 1
\item I re-implemented CycleGAN and applied Differential Augmentation, training on Kaggle's Dataset to create a game that tests players' ability to differentiate between authentic paintings created by Claude Monet and AI-generated paintings.
