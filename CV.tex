\quad
\begin{tightemize}

% -> point 1
\item Improved \& automated A/B testing tools surrounding internal A/B testing such as duration estimation or automated analyses tool. Improved internal backend used for managing experiments.

% -> point 2
\item I led the `experimentable widgets` project, which enabled stakeholders to make changes to site widgets as A/B tests. To do this, I had to look into and make alterations to the larger internal architecture, which included 4 backends and 2 frontends

% -> point 3
\item I conducted multiple A/B/n tests, generating additional data and statistics. This experiment resulted in an estimated cost savings of £1 million per year for the company.

% -> point 4
\item I served as the primary reviewer for the team and was accountable for a large majority of the team's development operations and pipelines.

\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}

% -> point 1
\item Helped develop a company-wide ML algorithm responsible for short-term demand forecasting.

% -> point 2
\item Created data pipelines from the beginning, including configuring a virtual machine, Jenkins, and scripts.

\location{2021-present}
\begin{tightemize}

% -> point 1
\item Analyzed data on long-term treatment of PWS-type birthmarks.  Research revealed that if treatment is discontinued, the condition will worsen. Consequently, this lead to introduction of a novel sustained treatment for PWS.

% -> point 2
\item Currentely conducting research focused on predicting PWS-type birthmark treatment's efficacy. Applying AI imagining techniques such as GANs \& CNNs.
