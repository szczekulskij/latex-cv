\location{Sept 2020 – June 2021 | Manchester, UK}
\location{December 2021 – Present | Manchester, UK}
\quad
\begin{tightemize}

% -> point 1
\item Improved \& automated A/B testing tools surrounding internal A/B testing such as duration estimation or automated analyses tool. Improved internal backend used for managing experiments.

% -> point 2
\item I lead the `experimentable widgets` project, which enables stakeholders setting changes to site widgets as A/B tests. This required investigating and making changes to the bigger internal architecture, including 4 backends \& 2 frontends.

% -> point 3
\item Carried out multiple A/B/n experiments, providing further analyses and statistcs. Said experiment saved company an estimated £1 milion/year.

% -> point 4
\item Main reviewer for the team. I was also responsible for majority of the Team's dev-ops and pipelines.

\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}

% -> point 1
\item Helped develop a company-wide Machine Learning algorithm responsible for short-term demand forecasting.

% -> point 2
\item Set up from scratch data pipelines which included VM, Jenkins \& code setup.

\location{2021-present}
\begin{tightemize}

% -> point 1
\item Analyzed data on long-term treatment of PWS birthmarks. During ur research we discovered that PWS worsens over time once treatment has stopped, and lead to our suggestion of maintenance treatment.

% -> point 2
\item Currently researching the predicted treatment's efficacy using imagining techniques, including GANs \& CNNs.
