% -> point 1
\item I led several projects aimed at facilitating seamless A/B testing of existing features, such as those enabling alterations to widgets - a primary component of our websites. To achieve this, I implemented significant modifications to the overarching e-commerce internal architecture, encompassing 7 backends and 3 frontends.

% -> point 2
\item I enhanced and automated previously manual tools related to our internal A/B testing platform, which included tasks such as duration estimation, results generation, and metrics addition. Additionally, I bolstered and established acceptance and integration testing protocols for numerous components

% -> point 3
\item Through the execution of various A/B/n tests and detailed data analysis, I contributed to a projected £5 million increase in annual sales.

% -> point 4
\item I assisted in the development of an enterprise-wide machine learning algorithm and accuracy metrics, used for short-term demand forecasting. This algorithm is vital in making daily predictions for tens of thousands of shipments across hundreds of websites.

% -> point 5
\item I architected numerous data pipelines from the ground up, encompassing tasks such as writing Python scripts that automates generations of 7k lines long SQL, and configuring both virtual machines and Jenkins.

\item Analyzed data on Port-Wine-Stain (PWS) birthmark treatments to identify the threshold visit after which treatment progress plateaus; confirmed the hypothesis that untreated PWS worsens over time.
% Analyzed data on long-term treatment of PWS-type birthmarks.  Research revealed that if treatment is discontinued, the condition will worsen. Consequently, this lead to introduction of a novel sustained treatment for PWS.

% -> point 2
% \item I am currently conducting research that aims to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the numerical and visual success rate of laser treatment for birthmarks, by leveraging the relationship between the position and colour of the marks and the treatment's effectiveness.
\item Studied the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning in determining the success rate of treating PWS by leveraging the relationship between the position and colour of the birthmarks pre-treatment and the treatment's efficacy.
